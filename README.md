# Youtube Video Downloader

## Motivation of Development

My mom has always been a fan of karaoke so she downloads music videos to be saved
in a flash drive and be played in a car's radio. But the problem is, modern video resolution
is not compatible with the car's radio. She oftentimes asks me to download music videos and compress
them because she does not know how to and to busy to learn the nuances.

## Solved Problem

I made this program to make downloading and compressing an easier task for my mom so she only needs
to worry about getting the link of the YouTube video and in one single click it will download the video
then compress it to a compatible resolution for the car's radio.

## What I learned

Through this project, I learned how to use the Tkinter GUI Framework. I learned how to make class-based widgets, manually
threading tasks, and doing simple animations. I also learned how to implement the observer pattern in the use case of clicking buttons
and making multiple independent widgets react from it.
